# Online-Shopper-Purchase-Binary-Classification
This repository contains code and data for predicting online shoppers' purchase intentions based on their browsing behavior and session characteristics. It includes exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering. Binary classification models including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting are implemented and evaluated to predict whether a shopper will make a purchase. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize model performance.
